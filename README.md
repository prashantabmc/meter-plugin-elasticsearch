#### Boundary Meter versions v4.2 or later

- To install new meter go to Settings->Installation or [see instructions](https://help.boundary.com/hc/en-us/sections/200634331-Installation).
- To upgrade the meter to the latest version - [see instructions](https://help.boundary.com/hc/en-us/articles/201573102-Upgrading-the-Boundary-Meter).

### Plugin Setup

In order for the plugin to collect statistics from Elasticsearch, it needs access to the cluster stats, cluster health and nodes stats API endpoint. In a default installation, this would be `http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cluster/stats`, `http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cluster/health`, `http://127.0.0.1:9200/_nodes/stats` but the port or path may be modified in configuration.
